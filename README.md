# IMM-Final-Project

One of the most stressful weeks of a college/university
semester is finals week. During this time, due to chronic stress,
students will often overeat and gain weight. This paper intends to
focus on the change in body mass of a specific group (NYU female
students) during the final week (with chronic stressor present).
